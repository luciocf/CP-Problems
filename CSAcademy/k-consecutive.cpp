// CS Academy - K-Consecutive
// LÃºcio Cardoso

// Solution is the same as the editorial: https://csacademy.com/contest/ioi-2016-training-round-4/task/k-consecutive/statement/

// For a little bit more of detail, the transitions for each case while calculating dp[i][j] are:

//	* dp[i][j] += (j+1)*dp[i-1][j+1] (this means we added 'i' in the middle of two consecutive numbers, thus decreasing the amount of consec. numbers by 1)

//	* dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1] (this means we added 'i' straight after 'i-1', thus increasing by 1 the amount of consecutive pairs of numbers in the permutation)

//	* dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j] (this is the remaining case, inserting 'i' in any position except the ones above. Since j of them are in the middle of a pair of consec.
//                            numbers and one of them is right after 'i-1', there are (i-j-1) in this last case, and inserting 'i' in any of them does not change the
//                            the amount of consecutive pairs)

// After this, dp2[i][j] is the 'perm[i][j]' in the editorial and 'soma[i][j]' is the prefix sum in such dp.
