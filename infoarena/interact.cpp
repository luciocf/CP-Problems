// Solution:

// We'll add the characters in alphabetic order. When processing character c, we will maintain the current
// substring of the whole string formed only with characters from 'a' to (c-1).

// Suppose s = 'c_1 c_2 c_3 ... c_k'. We'll try to add c as many times as possible before c_1, then
// as many times as possible between c_1 and c_2, etc., until we try to add c as many times as possible after c_k.

// The amount of operations will be at most 100*26 + 100 (for every character, we try to add as much as possible between
// at most 100 positions of the string and every time the character can be added this operation is counted as one more position
// in the answer, so that's why there's a 100 being summed individually).
