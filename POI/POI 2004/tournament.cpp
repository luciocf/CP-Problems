// POI 2004 - The Tournament
// LÃºcio Cardoso

// Solution:

// Notations: Let V be the set of all players, W the set of all winners, and L the set of all losers.

// Lemma 1: Every player in W wins from every player in L.

// Proof: Suppose there is a pair (u, v) such that u belongs to W, v belong to L and u doesn't win from v. Then, take any configuration C
// of matches such that u wins. Remove the match that v loses from C and add a match that v wins from u as a last match. Then, in this scenario,
// v wins the tournament, which is an absurd.

// Lemma 1 suggests the following algorithm to find all winners:

// (Algorithm 1)
// 1. Let W' be a subset of W. At first, insert any winner S into W'.
// 2. While there is a player v such that v doesn't lose from every player in W', insert v into W'.

// Lemma 2: W' = W.

// Proof: Let's first prove that every player in W' wins. Let v the player to be added in W' in step 2. If v = S, by definition, v wins.
// Otherwise, let u be any player in W' such that v doesn't lose from u. Since u is a winner, take any configuration C
// of matches such that u wins. Remove the match that v loses from C and add a match that v wins from u as a last match. Then, it is proven
// that v wins and inductively, every player in W' wins. Now, it's simple to notice that every player in V / W' loses, since due to step 2
// of our algorithm, every player in W' wins from every player in V.

// To find an initial player S that wins, apply the following algorithm:

// 1. Let x = 1. Mark x as visited
// 2. While there is any player y not yet visited that wins from x, let x := y and mark x as visited. Otherwise, x is a winner.

// Then, all that remains is applying the Algorithm 1. To do that, maintain a set of pairs (a, b) where a is the amount
// of winning players in W' that win from b. At any moment, let P = (a, b) be the pair with minimal value a. If a is smaller than the size of W', 
// we insert v = b in W' and remove P from the set and update the pairs whose value b lose from v. Otherwise, we finish the algorithm.

// Overall complexity is O(m log n).
