// Solution:

// 1. Call the two chosen vertices A and B. Root the tree at A. Suppose node B wasn't chosen and let T[u] be the
// smallest amount of time to reach everyone on u's subtree after u was reached. Then we have the following:
// T[u] = max(T[v_i] + i), where v_i is the ith children of u ordered decreasingly by T[v_i]. It's simple to calculate all values
// T with a single DFS, and the answer in this case would be T[A].

// 2. Now, we know that node B is in the tree. Notice that for all nodes who aren't in the subtree of any node on the path A->B, 
// it is always optimal for A to reach it first. Similarly, for all nodes on B's subtree, it is always optimal for B to reach it first.
// Therefore, we can define the last node on the path A->B that A will reach and "cut" this vertex's edge to his parent, separating the tree
// in 2 components. The first component represents all vertices A will reach, while the second one represents all vertices B will reach.
// We can therefore run the DFS on (1) on both components and the answer will be the maximum between them. This algorithm runs in O(n^2).

// 3. Let C_1, C_2, ..., C_p be the vertices on the path A->B, where C_1 = A and C_p = B. Call C_k the first node in the path such
// that when "cutting" this vertex's edge, B's component has a larger cost than A's component. Notice, then, that there are only two
// optimal points for cutting: C_k and C_{k+1}. Cutting C_k gets us the minimal cost when B's component is the greatest and cutting C_{k+1} gets us
// the minimal cost when A's component is the greatest.

// 4. We can find the optimal cutting point using a Binary Search and the previous DFS. The final solution has complexity O(n log n).
